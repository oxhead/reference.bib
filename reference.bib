	Annote = {Resource-centric is the most common way to specify resource requirement, but it may not be proper for cloud platform. Job-centric resource model, on the other hand, allows a cloud provider to manage resource with higher flexibility. One example is to run the same MapReduce job with different set of resources. This resource malleability conflicts with resource-centric management. The job-centric property fits better in multi-tenant environment. This property alone with performance prediction can achieve better resource model.},
